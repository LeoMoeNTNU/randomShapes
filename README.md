# randomFormer

I made a program that made random shapes a while ago and I'd like to have it on my git. 
It uses a class, which doesn't make much sense and is probably easy to fix but I haven't. 
You see the visual by going on FrontEnd.py and running the file. 
The file builds bigger shapes if you put the slider further to the right. 

To run: 
    run FrontEnd.py
